Analytics of mouse track on open dataset (https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/f78jsh6zp9/2) for UEBA 

User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) is a type of cybersecurity technology that analyzes user behavior and identifies anomalies or unusual patterns that could indicate a security threat. Mouse tracking is one of the behavioral data sources that can be used for UEBA.

Mouse tracking involves recording the movements and clicks of a user's mouse as they interact with a computer system. UEBA systems can analyze this data to gain insights into how users typically navigate through different applications and interfaces, including the speed and frequency of their movements.

By using machine learning algorithms to analyze mouse tracking data, UEBA can identify patterns that deviate from the norm, such as sudden changes in behavior or unusual access to sensitive data. These anomalies can then be flagged for further investigation by security analysts, who can use the insights gleaned from mouse tracking data to help identify potential threats or insider attacks.

There are several machine learning algorithms that can be used with a dataset that includes mouse track data for user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA). Some of these algorithms are:

- Decision tree algorithms can be used to identify patterns in mouse track data and create rules that can be used to identify anomalous behavior. Decision trees can also be used to create a scoring system that rates the likelihood of a particular behavior being anomalous.
- Random forest algorithms can be used to analyze mouse track data and identify anomalous behavior by combining multiple decision trees. This can help improve the accuracy of UEBA systems by reducing the impact of outliers and noise in the data.
- Neural network algorithms, such as deep learning, can be used to analyze mouse track data and identify patterns that may be difficult to detect with other machine learning algorithms. Neural networks can also be used to create predictive models that can identify potential security threats before they occur.
- Support vector machine algorithms can be used to analyze mouse track data and identify patterns in user behavior. Support vector machines can also be used to create predictive models that can identify potential security threats based on patterns in the data.
